# Image Placeholders

This directory would contain the following images for the Tesla Crafted blog:

1. `tesla-header.jpg` - Main header background image
2. `model3-accessories.jpg` - Image for the Model 3 accessories article
3. `home-charging.jpg` - Image for the home charging solutions article
4. `model-y-exterior.jpg` - Image for the Model Y exterior accessories article
5. `tesla-tech.jpg` - Image for the tech upgrades article
6. `author1.jpg`, `author2.jpg`, `author3.jpg`, `author4.jpg` - Author profile pictures
7. `avatar-placeholder.jpg` - Default author avatar
8. `article-placeholder.jpg` - Default article image

For a real implementation, you would need to add actual image files here. You can use free stock photos from websites like Unsplash or Pexels, or create your own images. The Tesla Crafted logo can be created using graphic design tools or services like Canva.

When adding real images, make sure they're optimized for web use (JPEG or WebP format, reasonable file size) to ensure fast loading times.
